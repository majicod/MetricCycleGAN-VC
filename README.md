MetricCycleGAN-VC uses the following diagram for training, mainly the same blocks of MaskCycleGAN-VC paper but since there isn't any official implementation we used the unofficial version from this link: https://github.com/GANtastic3/MaskCycleGAN-VC. The main changes appear in our "train.py" file. This train.py file is for VC training as well as for STOI-Aware optimizations .
